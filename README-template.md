## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed

## My process

### Built with
- Vite
- VueJS Composition API
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- Pinia for store management

### Useful resources

- [Article on how to center a div](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-centre-an-element-in-css-with-tailwind) - This helped as I am very new to TailwindCSS, and I learned what the `h-screen` utility class was. 
- [Tailwind Official Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The official TailwindCSS documentation was very helpful as I could reference what available utility classes there were in the framework.
